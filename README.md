Updated Dexcom Share CGM watch face for the Pebble smart watch

Replaces Simple CGM which broke in September of 2020

This is a watch face that Type 1 Diabetics can use to monitor blood sugar glucose values. It displays the most recent value from the Dexcom Share monitoring unit. This is not a medical device, it does not provide information that should be used to make medical diagnoses, the author is not responsible for the data displayed on the watch face, and you should use this at your own risk.
